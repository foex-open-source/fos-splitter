<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <strong>FOS - Splitter</strong> plug-in is a region that divides its 2 subregions into 2 panels, separated by a draggable splitter bar. The subregions can be split horizontally or vertically, with numerous other layout options.</p>
<p>This region <strong>must</strong> have exactly 2 subregions and it works best with a template without margins or padding, such as Blank With Attributes.</p>
<p>This plug-in leverages the Spitter widget that is used in Page Designer. We have included it in this plug-in, as it required a few minor tweaks to support splitters hidden behind tabs, collapsed regions etc.</p>
